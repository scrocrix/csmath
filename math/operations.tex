\section{operations.Multiply}

Prove the correctness of method that multiply two natural numbers, for all integer constants $c \geq 2$.

\begin{theorem}
The algorithm recursively growing towards infinity.

\begin{proof}
In order to understand my reasoning behind it, we might want to represent the same algorithm mathematically, as such:

\[
    f(x,y) =
    \begin{cases}
        0, \text{if } x = 0\\
        f(c \times x, \frac{y}{c}) + x \bmod{c}, \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]

\begin{itemize}
  \item So that, $x, y \geq 0$
  \item And, $f(0, y) = 0 \mid y \in Z$
\end{itemize}

In mathematics, we can say that when dividing a number by zero (e.g. $\frac{n}{0}$) results into a closer fraction next to 0 which leads the result towards infinity.

\end{proof}

\end{theorem}
